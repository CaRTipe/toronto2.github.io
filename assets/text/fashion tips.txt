1. Minimalist

Stick to neutral tones (white, black, grey, beige).

Focus on clean cuts and high-quality basics.

Less is more — no loud logos, just sleek silhouettes.

Think tailored pants, plain tees, structured coats.

2. Streetwear

Oversized everything: hoodies, graphic tees, cargos.

Sneakers are the star — collect pairs that pop.

Play with layering: varsity jackets, puffers, denim jackets.

Accessories like caps, chunky chains, tote bags elevate it.

3. Grunge

Ripped jeans, flannels, band tees, leather jackets.

Stick to dark colors: black, deep reds, forest greens.

Boots (like Dr. Martens) are a must.

Messy, effortless vibe — nothing too polished.

4. Preppy

Polo shirts, chinos, v-neck sweaters, loafers.

Pastel colors and clean tailoring.

Think "college campus meets yacht party" energy.

Accessories like belts and watches are clean and subtle.

5. Y2K

Baggy jeans, baby tees, tinted sunglasses, chunky sneakers.

Loud colors, metallics, and lots of playful accessories.

Denim-on-denim looks, or graphic-heavy fits.

Vintage vibes but a little futuristic.

6. Soft Boy / Girl

Cozy sweaters, cardigans, pastel colors.

Mom jeans, Converse, bucket hats.

Layer with scarves and tote bags.

It’s all about looking approachable and a little artsy.

7. Techwear

Dark, futuristic fits (lots of black and grey).

Cargo pants, utility vests, waterproof jackets.

Zippers, buckles, tactical vibes.

Functionality meets style — think "urban ninja."
